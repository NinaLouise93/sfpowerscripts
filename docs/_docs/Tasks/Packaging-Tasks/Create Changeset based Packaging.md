title: Create a Delta Package 
category: Packaging Tasks
order: 12
---

This task is used to build a changeset (Delta/Diff between two git commits) based artifact based on the changes between two commits, which can then be associated with a release pipeline.It is only recommended you utilise a changeset based build process when working on an existing org in the process of refactoring, to eventually utilize modular (source based/unlocked packaging) repositories.

This task utilizes the sfpowerkit:project:diff. In case you face any issues with the  diff not being accurate, please raise an issue in the sfpowerkit github repository.
